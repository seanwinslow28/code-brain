## **Project: Sprite-Sheet-Automation-Project\_2026 — Original Workflow Summary**

### **What It Is**

A **Manifest-Driven CLI Pipeline** that automates generating, auditing, retrying, packing, and validating AI-generated pixel art sprite sheets for 16BitFit Battle Mode — a 2D fighting game with 12 fighters in Street Fighter II style.

### **The Core Loop (7 Steps)**

The entire system follows one repeatable flow:

1. **CLI Command** → You run `pipeline:run` and point it at a `manifest.yaml` file. The manifest is the single source of truth — it defines the character, animation, frame count, quality thresholds, prompt templates, and export settings.  
2. **Orchestrator** → The central state machine initializes a `RunState`, locks the configuration into `manifest.lock.json`, and begins coordinating everything. It never talks to external tools directly — it delegates to Adapters.  
3. **Generator Adapter** → Calls Nano Banana Pro (Gemini) to produce frame candidates. Frame 0 uses the character's **anchor sprite** as a reference. Frames 1+ chain from the previously approved frame to maintain temporal consistency.  
4. **Auditor** → Each candidate frame is immediately evaluated against two tiers of quality checks:  
   * **Hard Fails (HF01–HF05):** Blocking. Wrong dimensions, missing alpha, baseline drift \>1px, naming errors, or gross anatomy failures \= instant reject.  
   * **Soft Fails (SF01–SF05):** Non-blocking but trigger retries. Identity drift (DINO/SSIM), palette drift, line weight inconsistency, temporal coherence issues, alpha halos.  
5. **RetryManager** → If a frame fails, it climbs a **Retry Ladder** with bounded attempts:  
   * Attempt 1: Edit from anchor (re-ground identity)  
   * Attempt 2: Re-anchor from original reference  
   * Attempt 3: Tighten prompt constraints  
   * Attempt 4: **Stop** with a diagnostic report explaining what failed and why  
6. **Packer Adapter** → All approved frames are sent to **TexturePacker CLI**, which compiles them into an atlas (`atlas.png` \+ `atlas.json`) with locked settings (trim, extrude, padding, no rotation).  
7. **Validator Adapter** → The atlas is loaded into a **headless Phaser 3** instance (via Puppeteer) that runs micro-tests: pivot/origin behavior, trim jitter/baseline stability, and naming key conventions. **Engine truth is the final arbiter** — if Phaser says it jitters, it fails regardless of what metrics said.

### **Technology Stack (and Why)**

| Tech | Role | Why This Choice |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Node.js (v20+)** | Runtime | Best ecosystem support for CLI tools and image processing libraries |
| **TypeScript 5.x** | Language | Strict type safety prevents bugs in complex state management (the pipeline has a lot of moving parts) |
| **Oclif 4.x** | CLI Framework | Purpose-built for Node CLIs — handles argument parsing, plugin architecture, and command organization out of the box |
| **Zod** | Validation | Validates manifest YAML and external data at runtime (catches config errors before they cause silent failures) |
| **Pino** | Logging | Outputs structured JSON logs — machine-readable for debugging, not just human-readable text |
| **Execa** | Subprocess calls | Safely executes external CLI tools (TexturePacker, Gemini CLI) with proper escaping across Windows/Mac/Linux |
| **Sharp** | Image processing | Fast Node.js library for normalizing, resizing, and analyzing images during auditing |
| **Puppeteer Core** | Headless browser | Launches real Chrome to run Phaser in a true WebGL context, so validation matches actual game behavior |

### **Architecture Pattern: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)**

The key design decision is that **core logic never touches external tools directly**. Every external dependency (Gemini, TexturePacker, Phaser) is wrapped in an **Adapter** that implements a typed interface. This means:

* You can swap Gemini for ComfyUI or OpenAI later without rewriting the pipeline  
* You can swap TexturePacker for Aseprite  
* You can swap Phaser for another engine  
* The audit/retry/orchestration logic stays stable regardless

### **MVP Scope**

The MVP was intentionally minimal — **1 Champion × 2 animations (Idle \+ Walk)**:

* **Idle (4 frames):** Validates identity consistency, palette, alpha handling with minimal motion  
* **Walk (6–8 frames):** Stress-tests temporal coherence and baseline stability in a looping cycle

The goal wasn't to generate the full roster — it was to **prove the system is trustworthy** before scaling. If the loop works reliably for Idle \+ Walk, it scales to everything else.

### **Key Artifacts Per Run**

Every run produces a deterministic folder structure:

* `manifest.lock.json` — Frozen config snapshot  
* `state.json` — Atomically persisted pipeline state (resumable)  
* `audit/audit_log.jsonl` — Every frame evaluation  
* `audit/run_summary.json` — Aggregate stats (retry rate, reject rate, top failure codes)  
* `artifacts/frame_###/candidates/` — All generated candidates  
* `export/atlas.png` \+ `atlas.json` — Final packed sprite sheet  
* `validation/results.json` — Phaser test results

### **The "Engine Truth" Principle**

This is the project's north star: **if it plays cleanly in Phaser, it ships. If metrics say "pass" but the animation jitters in-engine, it fails.** The pipeline treats AI output as raw material to be validated — not final product. Phaser is the regulator.

That's the original pipeline as designed in January 2026\. The later **Hybrid Pipeline Plan** (February 2026\) extended this foundation with video model interpolation and the Pixel Quantizer to solve the walk cycle temporal coherence problem, but the core orchestration, auditing, retry, packing, and validation infrastructure remained unchanged.
