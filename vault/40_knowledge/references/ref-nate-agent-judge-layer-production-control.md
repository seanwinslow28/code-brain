---
The next serious agent failure won’t look like a jailbreak. It’ll look like an email sent because the thread seemed to imply approval, a customer record updated because the old value looked stale, a pull request opened because the tests passed and the change looked done. None of that requires the model to misbehave, which is what makes it hard. The risk starts where the product gets useful: when language turns into action.

A chat demo lives in suggestion space. The model drafts, summarizes, answers, proposes, and if it’s wrong, the user rejects it. The cost is local. A production agent lives closer to consequence: it can notify someone, expose private information, change a shared record, trigger a workflow, or spend money. That moves a question to the center of the product demos never had to answer: who decides whether the agent should be allowed to act?

A better prompt doesn’t really answer it. Telling the model to “be careful” doesn’t either. Approval modals technically reduce risk but ruin the workflow. Users either click through out of habit or stop using the system. The answer that’s actually working is architectural: a separate judge wrapped around the actor, deciding whether each proposed action should move forward. If you’re building agents that act, this is the layer of the product you cannot bolt on later.

**Here’s what’s inside:**

- **The Lindy example.** How a multi-channel agent product hit the failure mode every production system eventually faces, and the architectural fix that worked.
- **Why prompting and approval modals both fail.** The structural reasons a single prompt can’t pursue a task and police it at the same time.
- **Orchestration is not judgment.** Why coordinating agents and judging their actions are different problems with different homes in the stack.
- **The builder toolkit.** Action classification, proposals, specialist judges, eval, memory governance, and what to build first.
- **The OpenBrain Judge Extender guide + the prompt kit that builds your first judge.** Five prompts that take you from “my agent acts” to a working judge at your highest-risk boundary, plus the full implementation spec for wiring that judge to durable memory, provenance, and structured write-back so it doesn’t start every session from zero.

Start with the team that hit this wall publicly and figured out what to do about it.

## LINK: Grab the OpenBrain Judge Extender Guide and the prompts

If you’re shipping an agent that sends emails, opens PRs, updates records, or hands work to other agents, you’ve probably already noticed the two places it gets hard. The first is designing the judge itself: where it sits, what it evaluates, how to keep the actor from winning with confident prose instead of real evidence. The second is what happens after the judge works for a few weeks and starts making decisions based on context that’s stale, inferred, or flat wrong.

The [prompt kit](https://promptkit.natebjones.com/20260508_246_promptkit_1) is for the first problem. Five prompts that take you from action surface mapping through judge criteria, a deployable judge system prompt with four-outcome logic, an eval suite built around mundane failures, and a full architecture audit.

The OpenBrain Judge Extender guide is for the second. Action proposal schemas, judge recall and decision APIs, provenance labels, memory use policies that keep generated lessons from silently becoming future instructions, a review queue, and an inspector for every judgment event.

Use the prompts to build the judge. Use the guide to make sure it remembers what it learned.

## How Lindy built AI agent guardrails

The cleanest public example right now is Lindy.

Lindy’s agents work across email, calendars, follow-ups, messages, and connected tools. That breadth is what makes the product useful, and it’s also what makes the product risky: an agent that can send an email or schedule a meeting on your behalf isn’t just helping you think anymore.

Lindy has discussed this approach publicly. During internal testing, they hit the failure every serious agent product eventually has to face. The agent started sending emails that hadn’t been properly authorized. That’s a production-level failure. It’s the central problem facing agent products. The agent was doing the thing users want agents to do, which is infer the next step and remove work from the human. The same behavior that makes the product valuable can make it act too far.

Lindy tried the obvious approaches first. Prompting helped, but only to a point. You can tell an agent not to be too proactive, but the value of the product *is* proactivity. You can tell it to require authorization, but the model still has to decide what counts as authorization inside a messy conversation. Was the user asking the agent to draft an email or send it? Did a prior instruction still apply? Was an external person’s reply enough to continue the workflow? Did the agent start a chain of action and then treat the chain itself as permission to keep going? Those aren’t wording problems. They’re control problems.

Manual confirmation helped too, but it carried real product cost. Once every useful action requires the user to stop and approve it, the agent stops feeling like an agent. It becomes a normal workflow with a model in the middle and an approval button at every meaningful step. Worse, the user eventually stops making real decisions. The approval moment becomes another box to clear.

Lindy’s important move was architectural. Before side-effectful actions execute, a separate validator LLM checks whether the action is authorized. The acting agent has to justify what it wants to do and cite evidence from the task history or memory. The validator reads that justification, compares it against the available context, and decides whether the action should proceed.

The structural point isn’t that the second model is magically more trustworthy than the first. It’s that the two systems are doing different jobs. The actor is trying to complete the task. The judge is trying to decide whether the proposed action is authorized, supported, and safe. Different optimization targets deserve different control surfaces.

A single agent asked to plan, retrieve, infer, act, comply with policy, preserve privacy, avoid side effects, and know when to stop is carrying too much responsibility inside one prompt. It works in a demo. It’s fragile in production. Splitting the jobs narrows the judge’s question — instead of deciding what the whole system should do next, it’s deciding whether *this specific proposed action* should be allowed given the available evidence and policy. That’s a much better unit of software. It can be specified, tested, versioned, improved, and owned.

I keep coming back to that word “owned.” Most of the agent failures I’ve tracked over the past year share the same root cause: nobody in the organization could point to the component that was supposed to say no.

The judge layer works as calibrated autonomy. Low-risk work moves quickly, actions that exceed authorization get caught, actions that are directionally right but unsafe as written get revised, and the cases that need a human get escalated.

## Why prompting fails for AI agent safety

Prompting still matters. Bad instructions produce bad systems. But prompts alone are the wrong place to put the full judgment burden, because the same model is being asked to pursue the task and police the boundary of the task, and those jobs can conflict.

Take a sales follow-up. A prospect replies, “Can you send over the pricing deck?” The actor agent may reasonably infer that sending the deck is the helpful next step. Several questions sit underneath that inference, though. Did the user authorize this kind of send? Is this the right deck, and is it current? Does it contain non-public pricing? Is the prospect under NDA? Did the agent initiate the thread and now treat the other person’s reply as permission to continue?

None of those are language questions. They’re product-control questions, and they depend on authorization, policy, context, and consequence.

The same problem appears in coding agents. “Fix the failing test” and “change the production configuration” can both be described fluently by the model, but they aren’t the same kind of action. Opening a draft pull request isn’t merging to main. Adding a local file isn’t deleting customer data. Running a test suite isn’t running a command against production infrastructure. The model can make all of those sound reasonable. The product has to decide which ones the agent is allowed to take.

Blanket approval gates are the crude answer. They reduce risk by forcing the user to approve everything, but they also destroy the workflow and train the wrong behavior. A human asked to approve every low-risk action stops acting like a reviewer and starts acting like a throughput bottleneck. After enough modals, approval becomes muscle memory rather than judgment.

A judge layer is more precise because it lets the product treat different actions differently. Some actions flow through automatically. Some get blocked. Some get revised before execution. Some go to a human. The goal isn’t to remove human review — it’s to put human review on the decisions that actually require human judgment.

## The pattern is showing up everywhere

Lindy puts the judge layer close to the action boundary. The validator runs before an external side effect happens.

JP Morgan’s “Ask David” puts the same pattern at a different boundary. The ZenML LLMOps Database describes Ask David as a multi-agent investment research assistant with a supervisor agent, specialist agents for structured data, unstructured documents, and analytics, and post-processing nodes before delivery. One of those post-processing nodes is a reflection node that uses LLM-as-judge to validate generated answers, with retry logic when validation fails. The system also keeps humans in the loop because the domain is high stakes.

That’s a different boundary than Lindy’s. Lindy’s validator decides whether an action should execute. Ask David’s reflection layer decides whether an answer should be trusted before a human relies on it. The distinction matters because it tells you where to put the judge. In a workflow that ends in an action against another system, the judge belongs immediately before the action call. In a workflow that ends in an answer a human will use to make a decision, the judge belongs immediately before delivery, with retry logic so the system can fix what it can fix automatically.

OpenAI’s Agents SDK shows the same idea becoming framework infrastructure. The SDK has agent-level input and output guardrails, plus tool guardrails around custom function tools. That last distinction matters: input guardrails check whether the request should proceed, output guardrails check the final answer, and tool guardrails run around function-tool invocation, which is often where the system crosses from language into action.

The broader direction is that production agents aren’t becoming one giant model call. They’re becoming stacks: actors, tools, judges, traces, handoffs, memory, policies, review paths. The judge isn’t a single component you add once. It’s a class of components placed at the boundaries where work can go wrong: intake, tool call, handoff, memory write, final delivery.

## Orchestration is not judgment

Agent architecture discussions tend to blur the line between orchestration and judgment, so it’s worth drawing carefully.

Gas Town and Gas City focus on operating multiple agents as a system. Their language around roles, crews, witnesses, polecats, convoys, sessions, beads, events, mail, and controller behavior points at the practical problem of coordinating agent work. Once a system has more than one agent, it needs infrastructure for assignment, recovery, identity, state, work history, and handoff.

That’s orchestration infrastructure. It answers questions about who is working, what the work item is, where the work lives, how it’s assigned, how state persists, and how agents coordinate across sessions. Judgment is a different problem. Orchestration decides who does the work. The judge layer decides whether the work is allowed to move forward.

Running twenty agents in parallel doesn’t remove the need for judgment. It increases it. There are now more tool calls, more handoffs, more partial outputs, more conflicting assumptions, and more chances for one agent to pass bad work downstream.

The same distinction applies to coordination systems like Thrum. Thrum provides persistent messaging for AI agents across sessions, worktrees, and machines. That’s mailboxes, queues, routing, and handoff infrastructure for agent teams, which sits adjacent to the judge layer rather than identical to it. Coordination moves work between actors. Judgment decides whether that work should be accepted, revised, blocked, escalated, or remembered.

OpenBrain belongs in another layer entirely. A judge needs trustworthy context. It needs to know what the user authorized, which policy applies, what the team decided before, whether a memory was observed or inferred, whether a prior failure should affect today’s decision, and whether an instruction has been superseded. Without that context, the judge guesses. With the wrong context, it becomes confidently wrong. OpenBrain’s role is continuity: it should give the judge scoped, provenance-aware context before the decision and record the outcome afterward. It shouldn’t pretend to be the orchestrator or the judge.

The clean separation: runtime and orchestration in tools like OpenClaw, Gas Town, Gas City. Coordination and handoff in tools like Thrum, mailboxes, queues, work items, and beads. Judgment and control in validators, reflection nodes, tool guardrails, custom policy judges. Continuity and memory in systems like OpenBrain. Human review for escalation, approval, correction, and accountability. Each layer has a different job, and collapsing them makes the system hard to reason about and harder to evolve. A policy change shouldn’t require re-prompting the actor, rewriting the orchestrator, and reworking the memory layer because none of them clearly owns the rule.

## How LLM judges fail in production agents

The biggest mistake builders make once they accept the judge pattern is treating the judge as a truth oracle. The judge is another component in the system, with its own failure modes.

The first is **correlated judgment**. If the actor and judge use the same model, the same assumptions, the same context, and the same prompt style, they share blind spots. The judge may catch surface mistakes while missing the same category error the actor made. In the worst case, the judge becomes a confidence-laundering layer: the action the actor already wanted to take, now blessed by a second model that thinks in a similar shape. That doesn’t make same-model judges useless. They still catch missing evidence, malformed arguments, policy mismatches, and careless tool calls. But for higher-risk actions, correlated failure is a real architectural risk, and the mitigation is a combination of clearer criteria, different prompts, structured outputs, deterministic policy checks, model diversity where it pays for itself, and human review where consequence justifies it.

The second is **specification gaming**. If the judge rewards well-justified actions, the actor learns to over-justify. If the judge blocks suspicious language, the actor learns to phrase risky actions more innocently. The system ends up optimizing the conversation between actor and judge rather than the quality of the underlying decision. Which is why the action proposal matters so much. The actor shouldn’t be able to win by writing a more persuasive paragraph. It should have to make structured claims about the intended action, the evidence, the authorization, the expected consequence, the sensitivity of the data involved, and the rollback path. The judge inspects those claims against criteria rather than performing a vibe check on the actor’s prose.

The third is **escalation drift**. When context is thin, the safe move is often to escalate. That may be correct for one action, but across thousands of actions it turns the product into a paging system for humans. The product claims to be autonomous, but the human is doing most of the consequential decision-making. The opposite, **under-escalation**, is just as bad: if policy is vague and the actor’s justification sounds confident, the judge approves an action that should have gone to a human. Confident language is cheap. Authorization isn’t.

The fourth is **latency and cost**. Every judge call adds time and compute. In an interactive product, even small delays matter. In a multi-agent pipeline, they compound across handoffs. A judge that wraps every action with the same expensive process eventually gets bypassed, disabled, or resented. Low-risk actions need lightweight checks. Expensive or high-risk actions can justify more expensive judgment.

The fifth is **policy drift**. A judge prompt that worked last quarter encodes last quarter’s rules. If the company changes its data-handling policy, customer-communication policy, approval thresholds, or legal review process, the judge has to know. Without policy versioning, the system silently runs stale judgment.

None of this means LLM judges are unreliable and therefore useless. It means judges have to be operated like production systems — with scoped responsibility, explicit criteria, eval suites, policy versions, escalation budgets, latency budgets, cost budgets, human override tracking, and a clear owner. A judge layer without evaluation is just another agent.

## Why specialist AI judges outperform general ones

Once judgment becomes a real job, the next question is how many judges to run.

A single general judge has obvious appeal: one prompt, one call, one place to change behavior. That’s usually the right place to start. But a single judge doesn’t scale forever. Eventually it has to know authorization rules, privacy rules, code-review rules, customer-communication rules, payment rules, deletion rules, data-retention rules, and quality rules for every output type. The prompt gets longer, the criteria get blurrier, and every new policy becomes another paragraph in the same overloaded judge.

Specialist judges scale better. An authorization judge asks whether the user approved this class of action. A privacy judge asks what data is being exposed and to whom. A policy judge maps the action against explicit policy IDs. A reversibility judge asks whether the action can be undone and what rollback would require. A quality judge asks whether the artifact meets the domain bar. A security judge asks whether the action touches secrets, permissions, production systems, or sensitive infrastructure. Each specialist has a tighter scope, which makes it easier to write, test, tune, and replace.

The cost is composition. Multiple judges have to collapse into one runtime decision, and that combination logic is itself policy. A block usually dominates an allow. An escalation dominates an allow when confidence is low and risk is high. A revision wins when the action is basically right but fixable. An allow requires every relevant check to clear.

Specialist judges also let the team choose different models and methods for different checks. A privacy classifier can often be cheaper and more deterministic. A legal-quality judge may need a larger model and retrieved precedent. A production-command judge may combine rules, environment metadata, and human approval rather than relying on an LLM at all.

Most teams should start with one judge and split it when the prompt becomes too long to reason about. The first split is usually authorization or privacy, because those are the failures with the worst consequences when missed.

## What AI agent judges evaluate before action

A useful judge isn’t a vague safety model floating somewhere near the workflow. It’s a decision layer placed at a boundary. The actor wants to do something. It produces a proposal. The judge evaluates that proposal against criteria and returns a decision the runtime can enforce.

The criteria vary by action type, but they cluster into a few recurring categories.

**Authorization**: Did the user explicitly authorize the action? Is that authorization still current? Is the actor extending a prior instruction beyond its intended scope? Is the actor mistaking an external party’s request for the user’s approval?

**Evidence**: Is the actor relying on the right source of truth? Is the target correct? Is the supporting information sufficient? Is any important source stale, disputed, or superseded?

**Exposure and risk**: What data will be exposed and to whom? What systems will change? Is the action reversible? What’s the worst plausible consequence if the actor is wrong?

**Policy**: How does the proposed action compare against project rules, company policy, legal requirements, security boundaries, customer commitments, and prior user instructions? When does policy require human approval rather than automated execution?

These criteria need to exist before the judge prompt does. A judge prompt is an implementation of policy, not the policy itself. If the criteria are vague, the judge will be vague. If the criteria are clear, the judge can be tested.

This is the same discipline that already applies to other parts of software: define the boundary, define the policy, define the inputs, define the outputs, test the behavior. The judge layer deserves the same treatment.

Traditional access control works because it isn’t asked to think very much — it enforces a written rule against a written claim. The judge layer has a harder job because the claim and the rule are often partly linguistic. “Send the latest deck” isn’t a clean permission object. “Help with this customer follow-up” isn’t a complete authorization scope. The judge’s job is to bridge that fuzziness without pretending it’s precise. Which is why the actor’s proposal matters so much — the system has to turn an implied action into something inspectable.

## How to build an AI agent judge layer

Building an agent that can act starts with mapping the action surface. Not every action needs the same level of judgment. A read-only summary isn’t sending an email. Drafting a response isn’t sending it. Opening a branch isn’t merging to main. Labeling a ticket isn’t changing a customer permission.

A practical classification has four classes:

- **Read-only actions**: retrieve, summarize, inspect, classify, draft, compare, explain. Usually no heavy judge unless they involve sensitive data, regulated domains, high-stakes recommendations, or external delivery.
- **Reversible writes**: drafts, labels, internal notes, local files, branch changes, non-public tasks. Lightweight validation or post-action audit, especially when the work affects a shared internal system.
- **External side effects**: sending messages, booking meetings, updating external systems, triggering workflows, posting publicly, opening PRs, notifying customers, changing shared records. Usually pass through a judge before execution, because they affect other people or systems outside the agent’s private workspace.
- **High-risk actions**: spending money, deleting data, changing permissions, merging code, submitting legal or financial work, exposing sensitive information, executing production commands. Judge plus a human approval path, unless the system has a very narrow, explicit policy that permits automation.

This classification prevents two common failures. Treating every action as harmless produces incidents. Treating every action as catastrophic produces unusable products.

Once actions are classified, the judge belongs at the action boundary itself. Judgment shouldn’t be a vague after-the-fact evaluation — it should sit exactly where the agent crosses from thinking to doing.

Before a side-effectful tool call, the actor should produce a structured action proposal stating the intended action, the reason, the supporting evidence, the user authorization, the expected consequence, and the rollback path. In plain English: what it wants to do, why, what evidence supports it, where the user authorized it, what will happen if it executes, and how the system can recover if it’s wrong. That gives the judge a real object to inspect.

For an outbound email, the proposal might include the recipient, a digest of the body, the attachment, the source of authorization, the prior thread, the data exposed, and the fact that the action isn’t meaningfully reversible once sent. For a pull request, it might include the branch, changed files, test status, risk class, deployment implications, and whether the agent is opening a draft, requesting review, or trying to merge. For a CRM update, it might include the field, the old value, the new value, the source evidence, the customer impact, and whether there’s an audit log or rollback path.

Forcing the actor to produce this proposal also improves the actor. Knowing it has to justify an action before execution tends to make it more careful about evidence, target selection, and authorization.

The next move is to keep the actor and judge separated. The actor optimizes for task completion. The judge optimizes for authorization, policy, correctness, privacy, and risk. They can use the same model family and share context, but they shouldn’t be the same role. A single prompt asked to pursue and police a task will tend to pursue.

The judge should have four possible outcomes, not two. **Allow** means the runtime may execute. **Block** means it must not. **Revise** means the action is directionally valid but needs a change before execution. **Escalate** means the runtime should route the decision to a human or a higher-trust process.

That four-way split is more useful than approve-or-reject. Production workflows usually need a middle path. The right answer is often that the agent should draft the email but not send it, archive the record instead of deleting it, remove the attachment, ask for explicit approval, use an internal channel instead of an external one, lower the spend limit, or route the decision to legal. A judge limited to yes and no becomes a source of friction. A judge that can revise and escalate becomes part of the workflow.

## Human review is a product surface

Human review should be designed deliberately, not used as a blanket excuse.

If every action needs human approval, the agent hasn’t really changed the workflow. If no action needs human approval, the system is probably pretending risk doesn’t exist.

A better design routes low-risk actions automatically, blocks clearly invalid actions automatically, revises directionally correct actions with fixable problems, and escalates anything ambiguous, sensitive, irreversible, or high-impact. The human reviews the edge cases instead of babysitting the whole system.

The important thing is to measure the review surface. Escalation works as an operating rate, not a moral category. If escalation climbs too high, the product stops feeling autonomous. If humans frequently override actions the judge allowed, the judge is too permissive. If humans routinely approve escalations without reading them, the review process is fake. If actors resubmit the same revised action without addressing the judge’s objection, the actor/judge contract is broken.

Exact thresholds vary by domain (a customer-support draft tool, a coding agent, an investment research assistant, and a production-ops agent shouldn’t share the same tolerance), but the principle is consistent: human review is a product surface to tune, not a vague safety fallback.

## How to evaluate AI agent judge systems

A judge layer needs its own evaluation suite, and not just a few red-team prompts. It needs a structured set of judgment cases that reflect the decisions the product actually has to make: cases where the correct answer is allow, cases where the correct answer is block, cases where the correct answer is revise, and cases where the correct answer is escalate.

The cases should include ordinary failures alongside dramatic ones. A realistic eval suite tests whether the judge catches an email addressed to the wrong recipient, an action that lacks user authorization, a decision based on stale memory, an instruction that’s ambiguous, an external party requesting something the user didn’t approve, an attachment that exposes sensitive information, a tool call with destructive arguments, a public comment that should have stayed internal, a correct action aimed at the wrong account, and a high-risk action with only partial authorization. These examples matter because production incidents usually come from mundane boundary failures. The agent didn’t go rogue. It acted one step too far, with too much confidence, in a situation where the system didn’t force the right question.

The metrics should reflect that. Track false allows, false blocks, escalation rate, revision rate, latency added, cost per judged action, human override rate, and incidents caught before execution. Track judge performance by action class rather than only in aggregate — a judge that performs well on read-only tasks may fail on customer communications, and a judge that catches privacy issues may over-block harmless internal edits.

The same discipline applies to memory. Did the judge retrieve the right context? Did it use unconfirmed memory as instruction? Did it ignore a user-confirmed policy? Did it treat stale information as current? Did it write back a lesson in a form that will actually help the next run?

If you can’t evaluate the judge, you don’t have a control layer. You have another model call.

## Decide what the judge remembers

Every judgment event creates operational knowledge. The system learns that a proposed action was blocked because authorization was missing, that a policy applies to customer emails, that a repo requires human review before merge, that a certain kind of generated output often needs revision, that a human corrected the judge in a particular way.

If all of that disappears into logs, the system doesn’t improve. If all of it gets dumped into memory without review, the system becomes dangerous.

The right path is structured write-back. Store the judgment event, the source, the decision, the reason, the memory used, the human correction (if any), and the future-use policy. Label the memory by provenance. Some memories are observed from a source. Some are inferred by an agent. Some are generated as possible lessons. Some are confirmed by a user. Some are disputed. Some are superseded. Those distinctions aren’t bureaucracy — they determine whether a future agent is allowed to use the memory as instruction or only as evidence.

This is where continuity systems like OpenBrain matter. The judge needs evidence going in and provenance coming out. It needs to know what the system remembers and how much trust each memory deserves.

In an agent system, memory functions as a future interpretation rule. If the system remembers the wrong thing, or remembers a generated inference as if it were a confirmed instruction, future agents become confidently wrong. Which is why agent-written memory should start as evidence, and instruction-grade memory should require human confirmation or trusted import. Judgment becomes durable only when memory is governed.

## What to build first

The first version doesn’t need to be a giant safety platform. It needs one workflow with one real action boundary.

Choose a workflow where an agent sends a customer email, opens a pull request, updates a CRM field, schedules a meeting, posts a message to a shared channel, or writes a memory that future agents may use. Classify the action. Define the judge criteria. Require an action proposal. Add a judge that can allow, block, revise, or escalate. Add a small eval set. Add structured write-back. Add human review for anything that could become future instruction.

I want to be careful not to overstate this. You don’t need a giant safety platform on day one. But you do need one real boundary where the system has to justify itself before it acts.

That’s enough to make the architecture real.

From there, expand action by action. The mistake is trying to solve agent safety in the abstract. The practical unit is smaller: one action boundary, one proposal format, one judge, one eval set, one write-back loop. Once the first loop works, the second one is easier because the contract already exists — the proposal format, judge criteria, eval harness, and memory write-back pattern travel across actions. That’s how the investment compounds.

## The bigger pattern

Agents are starting to look less like chatbots and more like managed workers. A managed worker needs task assignment (orchestration), communication (coordination), context (memory), permissions (access control), supervision (the judge layer), correction (human review), and a work record (provenance).

The first wave of agent products spent most of its energy on the worker. The next wave will spend more on the management system around the worker.

This is the argument in [Whoever Defines the Work Primitive Wins](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/ai-work-primitives-access-vs-meaning). Work primitives expose meaning: what the action is, what object it touches, what permission it requires, what risk it carries, how the outcome should be checked. The judge layer is the control layer on top of that meaning. If the system can’t describe the action, the judge has to guess. If the action is a typed, permissioned, reviewable work primitive, the judge can decide.

[OpenClaw Crossed The Runtime Line](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/openclaw-agent-runtime-model-swapping) showed the other half of this. A runtime can coordinate tasks, tools, models, channels, memory, and agents. But runtime maturity increases the need for judgment. The more durable the workflow, the more important it is to decide which actions, handoffs, and memories are allowed to persist.

The Stripe Sessions piece, [The Transaction Is Leaving The Store](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/agentic-commerce-buyers-power), makes the stakes concrete. Once an agent can carry payment authority, interact with merchants, or act on commercial intent, the action boundary isn’t theoretical. The judge layer becomes part of the trust chain.

That’s the larger shift. Lindy matters because it shows what happens when an agent becomes useful enough to create real side effects. Ask David matters because it shows what high-stakes domains do when fluent answers aren’t enough. OpenAI’s guardrails matter because they show these checks becoming framework primitives. Gas Town, Gas City, OpenClaw, and Thrum matter because they show the work becoming multi-agent, durable, and coordinated. OpenBrain matters because judgment needs memory with provenance, not hidden context soup.

The agent isn’t the whole product anymore. The product is the system around the agent that lets it act without turning every action into a gamble.

If your agent only drafts, you can get away with weak judgment for a while. The moment it acts, you need a judge — and once your system has multiple agents, you need judgment at the handoffs. Once those agents remember, you need provenance. Once they learn from prior work, you need review before memory becomes instruction.

The line between an agent demo and an agent product isn’t really what the agent can do. It’s how the surrounding system decides whether the agent should do it. That’s the judge layer, and if you’re building production agents, it’s the part of the product you can’t bolt on later.

YOUTUBE TRANSCRIPT

I can't tell you how many different times I have talked about the mistakes that agents have made. I've talked about the OpenClaw instance that started deleting emails until someone ran to unplug it. I've talked about the issues in production databases where Nate’sletter Nate’ that is appearing on the internet, in agent setups, in our workflows,

as of the last couple of months, that helps us to avoid these kinds of situations. Because we'd all love to avoid this, right? We don't want to be the person running to unplug the OpenClaw instance. Nate’s Nate’s I'm not talking about jailbreaks or hallucinations here. I'm talking about the agent doing the thing you trained it to do,

doing something past where it had permission, inferring authorization from a thread that didn't grant it, updating a record because the old value looked stale We have built our agents to act and we now need to build the layer that decides when and Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Nate’s

I think the cleanest public example of the kind of architecture I'm talking about is actually Nate’s Nate’s That's a real example. The irony of this is that Lindy has created agents to lift work, and so the agent thought it was being helpful by sending the email instead of checking Nate’s

Nate’lindy tried the obvious things to fix this first. They tried better prompts, and they tried requiring agent authorization. But both of those didn't really work. Nate’s for different reasons. The enforcement of prompting didn't work because even the most strict prompt does not hold across a really long context window. It doesn't hold in the agent's memory.

It doesn't work. That's not the way you guard agent behavior. Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Nate’s Nate’sletter and it's just a bunch of people clicking buttons and not paying attention. And so I admire the Lindy team for thinking carefully about the real solution to this problem. Because Lindy made an architectural move instead.

In the new Lindy design system, a separate validator model or judge model The validator reads the justification, checks it against the available content, and decides yes, no, or something in between. So all this is is two agents. One is trying to complete the task.

One is trying to decide whether the proposed action aligns with you, the user, and your intent. And what makes this work is specialization coupled with the new capabilities of long-running models. And so models work really well when we figure out specialization at the right grade. I think this is a great example of Lindy finding a pattern

that is at the correct grain for the agent capability we have today. Agents today can do multi-hour tasks. They are able to compose hundreds of tools together to do work. They have gigantic million token context windows. They're very powerful and designed to do work over time. Nate’s You only guard your intent.

And so all of that agentic focus on task is dedicated only to checking whether your intent is followed. And what that does is it enables us to take advantage of these new stronger models. and take the power of that new stronger model and put it in an appropriate specialization,

put it in a judge persona that allows us to check and guardrail dynamically what the agentic model that's in charge of actual execution is trying to do. It's perfect to me because it essentially allows us to look at the powerful capabilities we have today and apply a couple of simple personas that allow us to

build a very scalable system. Now, you might wonder, Nate, you dismissed prompts. Why don't prompts matter here? I thought you've talked about prompts and why they're important. Well, prompts do matter, but prompts cannot do a policing job. And I'll give you an example for this. Take a sales follow-up. Let's say a prospect

replies, can you send over the pricing deck? The actor agent would reasonably infer that sending the deck is the next helpful step. Several questions sit underneath the inference that agent just made in my example. Did the user authorize this kind of sales deck send? Is this the right deck? Is it a current deck?

Does it contain non-public pricing? Is the prospect under NDA? Did the agent start the thread and now treat the other person's reply as permission to keep going? None of these are language questions. All of these are actually control questions. They depend on authorization and policy and context and they generate real consequences.

If you write a prompt asking the agent to pursue sales and And to police a task, it will tend to pursue instead of to police. And the reason why is very simple. The agents are designed to get the job done, and you must give the agent a clear overarching goal number one in order to take

advantage of that power. Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Nate’s Nate’s Now, this, of course, raises the obvious question. How do you know which actions need which kind of judgment? You start by classifying them. I would group agent actions into four buckets. And I think the line that separates them is the degree to which an agent action has real consequences.

And this helps you shape the way you set up your LLM as judge, right? So read-only actions are very light, right? You can retrieve, you can summarize, you can inspect. There's no external Nate’s Nate’s of shared internal system and you do need validation,

but it may not need to have an audit trail depending on the tool set that you make available to the agent. If the tool set available to the agent includes permanent write or permanent delete, always, always, always, you need a very, very tight So those are the first two levels of impact. They're relatively light.

The third level of impact is a little more serious. This involves sending messages, booking meetings, stuff that has external impact, posting publicly, opening poll requests, notifying customers. These touch other people's Nate’s Natesnewsletter Nate’s Natesnewsletter Nate’s And that leads to an unacceptable risk profile. On the other side, you might treat every action as catastrophic or risky,

and then nobody's gonna want to use it because of all the approval patterns. That's what the Linde team ran into. So once you've classified the actions, the judge belongs You need to be very clear about instantiating the judge review when an agent makes a tool call, when an agent makes an intended action,

when an agent produces a proposal to make a decision. Natesnewsletter Natesnewsletter Natesnewsletter Now if you want to get into how you design dual agentic systems like this for each of these agentic risk classes, if you want to look at read-only, write-only, external actions that touch customers, how you handle really sensitive stuff like money, I go in-depth into

and agentic system design in the Substack Post for each of them. It's just too long and detailed for this video. What we need to have structurally is an understanding that the judge and agent system is a pattern that we can repeat, But the pattern needs to have the correct nuance for the data we're handling.

And that's why I've taken the time to go through these four briefly, and you can get all that detail at Substack. Now let's get into a piece most people miss. Most people think about these judge systems, and they naturally assume, We have LLM as judge, it can be a yes or a no and we move on.

Didn't Nate say simple primitives? Not quite. You actually want to give the judge a very intentionally allowed decision scope. Most production workflows almost always need a middle path. Nate’s That four-way split is the difference between an LLM control layer that people tend to build around and bypass because it's just too simple, yes and no is too simple,

versus a sophisticated LLM control layer that the agent can use to get You need to think about your escalations in that world as a rate that if it's too low is dangerous and if it's too high is going to damage trust in the agentic system.

Now I want to flag the failure mode that should worry you if you're trying to figure out how to design this system. It's somewhat model dependent and it's called Nate’s Nate’s Nate’s The entire LLM as Judge pattern works is because we assume the judge is probably going to be a closed source truly frontier model like ChatGPT 5.5.

If it is not, if you are using a Quen model, if you Nate’s Nate’s Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Nate’s Nate’s Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Natesnewsletter Nate’s They're looking more and more like managed workers. They're also not looking like swarms, by the way. Swarms was an idea in 2025 that I don't think has aged very well.

A managed worker needs task assignment, communication, context, permission, supervision, correction, and a work record. The first wave of agent products spent a lot of its energy on just getting agent workers stood up so that they can do that stuff. Nate’sletter Nate’sletter Nate’s Now, if you want to get into this in depth, the article on Substack

Nate goes way deep on this. I think it's one of the most important architectural patterns in the next two or three months as we build agentic systems that do real work. So I'm going to get into a full action proposal format by action type with the exact fields that an agent would have for an outbound email

Nate’s Substack Nate’s I also get into the memory governance model, including why agent written memory needs to be handled very specifically and carefully and how you distinguish agent written memory in judge systems. And I put the link in the system. If you're actually building this, that's where all the implementation details are. Natesnewsletter
