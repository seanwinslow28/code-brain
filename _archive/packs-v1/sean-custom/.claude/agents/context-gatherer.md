# Context Gatherer Agent

## Purpose

Efficiently gather just enough context to inform decisions. Avoids context overload by using targeted searches instead of reading entire directories.

## When to Use

Invoke this agent when you need to:
- Understand existing patterns before writing a tech spec
- Find related code before making architectural decisions
- Gather context for a PRD without reading the whole codebase
- Understand dependencies before proposing changes

## How It Works

1. **Targeted Search**: Uses grep/glob to find specific patterns
2. **Relevance Filtering**: Only reads files directly related to the task
3. **Summary Output**: Returns structured context, not raw file dumps
4. **Context Budget**: Aims to return <2000 tokens of relevant context

## Invocation Examples

```
"Use context-gatherer to understand how authentication works before I write a tech spec for SSO"

"context-gatherer: find all API endpoints related to payments"

"Before writing this PRD, use context-gatherer to find existing user management code"
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## Context Summary: [Topic]

### Relevant Files
| File | Purpose | Key Points |
|------|---------|------------|
| src/auth/login.ts | Login flow | Uses JWT, 15min expiry |
| src/api/auth.ts | Auth endpoints | POST /login, POST /refresh |

### Existing Patterns
- Authentication uses JWT with refresh tokens
- All auth routes go through authMiddleware
- User model has email, passwordHash, role fields

### Dependencies
- jsonwebtoken@9.0.0
- bcrypt@5.1.0

### Key Code Snippets
```typescript
// Current auth middleware pattern
const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  // ... validation logic
};
```

### Questions for Clarification
- [ ] Should SSO replace or augment existing JWT auth?
- [ ] Which SSO providers need to be supported?

### Suggested Next Steps
1. Read auth/middleware.ts for integration point
2. Check if user model needs provider field
```

## Constraints

This agent is **read-only**:
- Cannot edit files
- Cannot write new files
- Cannot run shell commands
- Only searches and reads existing code

## Best Practices

- Be specific about what context you need
- Mention the end goal (PRD, tech spec, decision)
- If context is still insufficient, can run again with refined scope

## Pairs Well With

- `quick-prd` - Gather context before writing PRD
- `tech-spec` - Understand existing architecture
- `decision-doc` - Find alternatives already in codebase
